# KIV/PIA Labs Example Application Project

Empty project with configured servlets and JPA, ready for creating a sample application.

## Steps

1. Check the project configuration - *pom.xml*, *persistence.xml*, *web.xml*. You should be well-acquainted with those by now.
2. What is dependency injection (DI)? What is inversion of control(IoC)? Check this great [article](http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html) by [Martin Fowler](http://www.martinfowler.com/)
3. Check DI implementation on the servlet layer in *org.danekja.edu.pia.web* packages. 
4. Implement user registration. How are you going to store passwords?
